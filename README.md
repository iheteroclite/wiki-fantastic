# wiki-fantastic
**Under Construction**

A simple wiki boilerplate written in Python+Django with Markdown entries

- Entries will be displayed if there is a corresponding file, otherwise a prompt to make a new entry is displayed.

- If the user types an incorrect url, the end of the url (deliminated with /) is checked against corresponding files, and a redirect suggestion is offered if there is such a file. Otherwise the user is prompted to create a new wiki page
